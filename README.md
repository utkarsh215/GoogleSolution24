Our team is actively participating in the Google Solution Challenge with a focus on Unit 4: Quality Education. Within this unit, we have chosen to address target 4.b, which emphasizes the expansion of higher education scholarships for developing countries. In our pursuit of this goal, we have developed a user-centric landing page as the starting point for our solution.
The landing page features two prominent buttons, offering a clear choice for users: "Scholarship Seeker" and "Scholarship Provider." This thoughtful design ensures that individuals can easily navigate to the section that aligns with their specific objectives. Upon selecting their role, users are directed to a dynamic geo.html page, which hosts an interactive world map.
Within the geo.html interface, users can either click on their country of interest or use a search function to locate it. For instance, if a user clicks on "India," the platform dynamically responds by presenting a comprehensive list of available scholarships within the country. This intuitive approach allows users to explore and access relevant opportunities with ease.
Our solution aims to bridge the gap between scholarship seekers and providers, fostering increased access to higher education opportunities in developing countries. By leveraging technology to streamline the scholarship discovery process, we aspire to contribute significantly to the realization of United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all.
